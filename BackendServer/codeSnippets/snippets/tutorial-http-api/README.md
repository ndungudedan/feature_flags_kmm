# HTTP APIs

A sample Ktor project showing how to create [HTTP APIs](https://ktor.io/docs/creating-http-apis.html) using Ktor.
> This sample is a part of the [codeSnippets](../../README.md) Gradle project.

## Running

To run a sample, execute the following command in a repository's root directory:
```bash
./gradlew :tutorial-http-api:run
```

Then, you can test HTTP endpoints as described here: [Test HTTP endpoints manually](https://ktor.io/docs/creating-http-apis.html#manual_test).
